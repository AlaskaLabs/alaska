:zap: **Fastest way to build HTML and CSS static sites.**

You don't have to learn complicated tools to build simple websites in a modular way.

Alaska uses efficient technology that's similar to what you're used to.

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**PugJS**](https://pugjs.org/) | Templating tool for building HTML in a beautiful and modular way. <br> It's basically HTML, but modular, programmable, and without closing tags. |
| [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/) | CSS processor that extends the capabilities of current CSS. |
| [**GulpJS**](https://gulpjs.com/) | File processor to watch your files as you edit, reload the page on save, and build minified files. |

### Running Alaska

Running Alaska is quite simple. You just install all the `npm` dependencies and you're good to go. 

But if you need some in-depth guidance, I'll hand it off to Poh, a friendly Polar Bear that will guide you on your journey to building in Alaska.
